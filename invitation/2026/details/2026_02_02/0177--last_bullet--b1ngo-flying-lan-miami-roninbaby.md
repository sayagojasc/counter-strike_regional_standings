### Roster Details<br />
Team Name: Last Bullet<br />
Roster: B1NGO, flying, lan, Miami, Roninbaby<br />
Global Rank: [177](../../standings_global_2026_02_02.md)<br />
<br />
Region: [Asia]( ../../standings_asia_2026_02_02.md)<br />
Regional Rank: [19]( ../../standings_asia_2026_02_02.md)<br />
<br />
Final Rank Value:  758.4<br />
<br />
Final Rank Value (758.4) = Starting Rank Value (755.9) + Head To Head Adjustments (2.5)<br />

#### Starting Rank Value<br />
To figure out a rosters's Starting Rank Value, first take the average of these four factors:<br />
- Bounty Offered: 0.299[<sup>1</sup>](#table2)
- Bounty Collected: 0.232[<sup>2</sup>](#table1)
- Opponent Network: 0.013[<sup>2</sup>](#table1)
- LAN Wins: 0.128[<sup>2</sup>](#table1)

The average of these factors is 0.168<br />
<br />
Next, take the maximum and minimum average across all teams and compute the following:<br />
- 400 + ( ( Roster_Average - Min_Average ) / ( Max_Average - Min_Average ) ) * 1600 = 755.9
- 400 + ( ( 0.168 - 0.000 ) / ( 0.755 - 0.000 ) ) * 1600 = 755.9


#### Factors<br />
Below you can see a table of all of the matches that contributed to this roster's Final Rank Value.<br />
Note:<br />

- For Bounty Collected, Opponent Network, and LAN Wins, we consider only the ten best results over the past 6 months.
- Raw values for those factors are multiplied by Age Weight. Bounty and Opponent Network values are also multiplied by Event Weight. The adjusted value is shown in parenthesis.
- The final value for a factor is the total of its adjusted values divided by 10. Bounty Collected is further scaled by the curve function[<sup>3</sup>](#curveFunction)
- Head to head adjustments are based on rosters' starting rank values. The results shown below are adjusted by Age Weight and not Event Weight

To calculate a roster's Bounty Offered:<br />

- First, take the sum of their top 10 scaled winnings ($1,540.00)
- Divide that value by the 5th highest value among all rosters ($342,293.96)
- The final value (0.00) is scaled by the curve function.[<sup>3</sup>](#curveFunction)

Top ten winnings for this roster:<br />
